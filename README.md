Hi :vulcan_salute:
===================

Welcome! I've created this portfolio to showcase some of the architectures that I've worked on. These may be from projects that I've worked on or projects that I've done consultations on (don't worry, they have no problem with me talking about architecture :relaxed:)

Architectural diagrams are my thing and [Miro](https://miro.com/app/) is my best friend! I never dive into a discussion without them. I think being able to visualize and play around with a diagram is the most efficient way to reach your solution faster and collaboratively.

I've built the following architectures over time. More details about them in their folders!
